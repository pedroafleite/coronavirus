This project explored the still-growing cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.

We used the coronavirus dataset provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to apply concepts of Spatial Data Analysis. 


This will allowed us to visualise the coronavirus data in ways that have not been commonly shown by media outlets such as:
1) Estimation of herd immunity
2) Spread of Covid-19 outbreak by neightborhood.

Unfortunately, the Ministry of Health gave up on disclosing Covid=-19 data by neightborhoods, which hindered the details of the spatial analysis.
