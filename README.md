# coronavirus

This project explored the still-growing cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.

We used the coronavirus dataset provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to apply concepts of Spatial Data Analysis. 

There has been an extensive data cleaning made in Excel to match both coronavirus data and the census data (the later which is presented above).

This will allowed us to visualise the coronavirus data in ways that have not been commonly shown by media outlets such as:
1) Estimation of herd immunity
2) Spread of Covid-19 outbreak by neightborhood.

Data focussed on:
1) São Paulo State
2) São José dos Campos (SP)
3) Rio Claro (SP)

Unfortunately, the Ministry of Health gave up on disclosing Covid=-19 data by neightborhoods, which hindered the details of the spatial analysis.
