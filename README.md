# coronavirus

This project explored the still-growing cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.

We used the coronavirus dataset provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to apply concepts of Spatial Data Analysis.

A few steps were required to be made prior to the data analysis and are not explicitly shown here:
- Data mining: Finding the pathways for the datasets on government sites.
- Data cleaning: most of which was made using Excel to assure that both coronavirus dataset and the census dataset had the same typography, especially in what regards the cities names.

This allowed us to visualise the coronavirus data in ways that have not been commonly shown by media outlets such as:
1) Estimation of herd immunity
2) Spread of Covid-19 outbreak by neightborhood.

Data focussed on:
1) São Paulo State
2) São José dos Campos (SP)
3) Rio Claro (SP)

Unfortunately, the Ministry of Health gave up on disclosing Covid-19 data by neightborhoods, which hindered the details of fine-grained spatial analysis by neightborhoods.
